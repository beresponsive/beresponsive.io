        %h5.presentation__presenter Presented by Dave Sharpe
        %p We have a timeline presentation by Dave from Visual Jazz - the Front End Lead at one of the foremost FED Agencies in Australia. His slides are great and give a really nice view of how far the Responsive Web has come since 2011... just a few short years, but loads has happened. If you want to get some inspiration for your own designs, get insight into how their projects were managed, how much they cost, and what technology they used - this one isn't to be missed!
